# Angular Fundamentals Seed

## Project Setup and Tooling

### Tools

*Text editor*: Visual Studio Code, you can [download it here](http://code.visualstudio.com) for both Mac, Windows and Linux.
*Browser*: Google Chrome, you can [download it here](https://www.google.com/chrome)

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have the following installed:

* Install the *latest version* of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (Mac or Windows)
* Mac users can optionally `brew install node` if they have [brew](http://brew.sh) installed

### Project Install

To grab the seed project, either Fork this repo or [click here to download](https://github.com/AditechGH/angular-pro-src/archive/master.zip) the `.zip` folder and extract the files wherever you like on your machine.

##### Step 1: Project Dependencies

Now that we have a package manager, we can install the project dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install our dependencies for running our Angular application.

#### Step 2: Running the project

To start the project in development, run:

```
npm run start
```

This will output some information about the project (such as the TypeScript version and build progress). Once you see "build completed", you are ready to code!

Open your browser to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to start running the code.
